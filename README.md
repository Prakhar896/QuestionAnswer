### For the users
QuestionAnswer offers an intuitive audience-facing question submission page through which audience members can easily submit questions they would like to ask. The audience can also opt to keep their identity private, resulting in `Anonymous` showing up on the organiser's screen.

### For the organizers
For the organisers, the questions are also intutively displayed in a neat list form. Each question entry has information about its author and ID too, making it easy to recognise.

The page showing the questions also updates in real-time, doing away with the need to continuously refresh to see new incoming questions from audience members. The organiser can choose to stop the real-time updates if they so choose.

After a question is answered, organizers can conveniently hit the "Answer" button, moving it to a separate screen where all already answered questions are displayed. This makes going through questions easier as there is a more focused view.
